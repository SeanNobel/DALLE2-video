# DALLE2-video

## Status

Something similar to Unet3D proposed in [Ho et al., Apr 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03458) is implemented and working.

## TODOs

- [x] Unet3D proposed in [Ho et al., Apr 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03458)
- [ ] Temporal super-resolution proposed in [Ho et al., Oct 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02303)
- [ ] Learning variance for video diffusion significantly unstabilized the training. Is there a way to stably learn variance?
